# Working Agreement
### Purpose:

The purpose of this Working Agreement is to establish a set of agreed-upon guidelines that the team will follow to ensure smooth collaboration, clear communication, and effective project execution.

### Team Collaboration Guidelines:

1. Communication:
+ Slack will be the main communication tool used by team members for daily conversations. 
+ Every Monday at 10 AM, there will be weekly meetings to discuss progress and establish objectives for the following week. 
+ Any pressing matters or obstacles will be promptly conveyed through the group chat or direct messaging. 
+ Throughout the project sprint, team members are expected to check in and submit updates at least once a day.


2. Task Management:
+ GitHub Issues will be used for the creation, assignment, and tracking of all tasks. 
+ After every day, team members will provide a report on the progress of the tasks they have been assigned. 
+ Any team member who faces difficulties or is unable to complete the assignment by the deadline shall notify the group at least 24 hours in advance. 
+ Pull requests will be used to submit code updates, which another team member will need to examine and approve before merging.

3. Decision-Making:
+ During weekly meetings, decisions on significant project components will be taken collectively. 
+ For smaller decisions, the responsible team member can make the call but must convey it to the rest of the team. 
+ If there are differences of opinion, the group will talk about it and come to a decision. 
+ The team lead or instructor will make the final decision if a consensus cannot be achieved.

4. Availability and Commitments:
+ Every team member will make sure they can work on the project for at least 10 hours a week. 
+ A team member needs to give the team sufficient notice if they will be absent for personal or other obligations. 
+ Team members are in charge of finishing the duties they have been given, and they will ask for assistance if they are unable to do so before the deadline.


5. Code Standards:
+ To ensure consistent formatting and style throughout the project, the team will utilize Prettier or ESLint. 
+ All code must adhere to accepted best practices for readability, maintainability, and performance. 
+ Before any new features are merged into the main branch, unit tests must be included. 
+ Before being merged, code should be carefully examined by a different team member.

6. Respect and Collaboration:
+ Everyone will be given the opportunity to share their thoughts and concerns, and team members will always conduct themselves with respect during conversations and feedback sessions. 
+ Active listening will be practiced. Negative or personal criticism will not be accepted; however, constructive critique is welcomed to help the work be better.

7. Conflict Resolution:
+ In the event of a disagreement, team members will try to work things out among themselves first. 
+ If the disagreement cannot be settled, it will be discussed in group during the weekly meeting. 
+ Conflicts that don't seem to be resolved will be brought up with the instructor for advice.

### Review of Agreement
This Working Agreement will be reviewed at the start of each sprint. If needed, adjustments will be made to improve team collaboration or project efficiency.
