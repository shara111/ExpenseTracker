## Project Description
Our group will be developing a budgeting website. This website will feature tools allowing users to track how much money they make or lose per month. The main tools will include: a dashboard that displays their monthly loss or savings with options for creating or adding expenses, a page for adding expenses, and a page for adding income. 

### Categorization
To provide users with a comprehensive and organized experience, our budgeting tool will allow users to categorize their expenses. Categories such as housing, auto, food, utilities, entertainment, and miscellaneous will make it easier for users to analyze their spending habits and identify areas for improvement. Each expense the user adds will require selecting a category, ensuring the dashboard displays relevant and categorized data.

### Dashboard Views
The dashboard will be the central hub for users to visualize and analyze their financial data. Key views that will be provided include:
- **Pie Charts:** Visual representation of expenses broken down by category. Users can quickly identify which categories consume the largest portion of their budget.
- **Bar Charts:** A month-over-month comparison of income and expenses to track trends over time.
- **Summary Table:** A detailed breakdown of all income and expenses for the current month, categorized and itemized.

### Multi-Account Support
To accommodate different user needs, our platform will support:
1. **Multiple Accounts Per User:** Users can create and manage multiple accounts, such as personal and business accounts, from a single profile. This ensures they can track finances independently for different aspects of their lives.
2. **Shared Accounts:** Users can share accounts with others, such as a spouse or business partner, allowing collaborative financial management. Shared accounts will have features like joint expense tracking and income contributions.

### Home Login Screen
This screen acts as a login screen where users can log in with their password and email and, therefore, can log in later on the other screens.

### Dashboard
The dashboard will be on the home page for the user. Users will be able to view how much money they are losing or saving per month. They will also have options for creating expenses or income for a designated month. Additionally, the dashboard will display visualizations like pie charts and bar charts to represent the user's financial data dynamically.

### Expenses
Users will be able to add a title, description, category, and cost associated with the expense. A button for adding expenses will be available from the dashboard, which will redirect them to this page. 

### Income
Users will be able to add a title, description, and amount associated with the income. A button for adding income will be available from the dashboard, which will redirect them to this page.

### Tech Stack 
### Backend
The backend will run on Node.js and will use an Express.js network to process HTTP requests. 

### Frontend
The Frontend will be made using React-Bootstrap and other UI libraries such as Shadcn, Material UI, and Tailwind. 

### Database
The database will run using either MongoDB or SQL combined with Prisma or Drizzle.

### Development Tools
The website will be developed using Visual Studio Code with a number of npm installations. We will use Postman and Thunder Client to test HTTP requests.
